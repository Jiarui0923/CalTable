# (CalTable) Calculate Table

`Update: 2024-12-15 Jiarui Li`


## Introduction
The `CalTable` package provides tools to facilitate reading, processing, and manipulating data within 
computational workflows. It integrates with `easyapi` and `easyaccess` to allow seamless interaction 
with APIs and local data files, enabling users to compute data as if they were working with pandas 
DataFrames.

If there is any issue, please put up with an issue or contact Jiarui Li (jli78@tulane.edu)
